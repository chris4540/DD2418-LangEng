% Here is the first paragraph. You can describe what the report is all about.
% Then you'd better start some sections.

\section{Question 1}

Download a list of English words from the corpus at \hspace{0.1em}
\href{https://github.com/dwyl/english-words}{github.com/dwyl/english-words}.
(download words\_alpha.zip) and cluster a random sample of 10000 of
these words into different clusters using a suitable method.

Implement the code in a Jupyter Notebook, display the results and visualisation
of the clustering in the notebook and export the Notebook into an HTML file.

Submit the HTML file.

\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Question 2a}
In the previous exercise, you clustered words. 
Describe how you might cluster multi-word phrases or sentences or paragraphs of 
arbitrary lengths.

\textbf{Ans:}
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

\subsection{Question 2b (Optional)}
Describe how you might cluster words from different languages

\textbf{Ans:}
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

\section{Question 3}
The earliest deep-learning attention mechanism was the method proposed by Bahdanau
in a paper on sequence to sequence models. 
 
Name some other variants of attention mechanisms (other than Bahdanau's method).

\section{Question 4}
\subsection{Question 4a}
Come up with an architecture for an ANN that would suffice to add up the digits of a 4-digit number.

\subsection{Question 4b}
Try to find the smallest that can do the job.  
What is the minimum number of fully connected layers (separated by non-linearities) 
that an ANN must have to compute the XOR function.

\section{Question 5}
How can you tell if an ML model is underfitting and overfitting?
