Here is the first paragraph. You can describe what the report is all about.
Then you'd better start some sections.

\section{First important topic}
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

% 1.  Download a list of English words from the corpus at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (download words_alpha.zip) and cluster a random sample of 10000 of these words into different clusters using a suitable method.
%     Implement the code in a Jupyter Notebook, display the results and visualisation of the clustering in the notebook and export the Notebook into an HTML file.  Submit the HTML file.

% 2a.  In the previous exercise, you clustered words.  Describe how you might cluster multi-word phrases or sentences or paragraphs of arbitrary lengths.
%  b.  (*Optional)Describe how you might cluster words from different languages

% 3.  The earliest deep-learning attention mechanism was the method proposed by Bahdanau in a paper on sequence to sequence models.  Name some other variants of attention mechanisms (other than Bahdanau's method).

% 4.  Come up with an architecture for an ANN that would suffice to add up the digits of a 4-digit number.
%     Try to find the smallest that can do the job.  What is the minimum number of fully connected layers (separated by non-linearities) that an ANN must have to compute the XOR function.

% 5.  How can you tell if an ML model is underfitting and overfitting?
