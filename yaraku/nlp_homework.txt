1.  Download a list of English words from the corpus at
    https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (download words_alpha.zip)
    and cluster a random sample of 10000 of these words into different clusters
    using a suitable method.

    Implement the code in a Jupyter Notebook, display the results and visualisation
    of the clustering in the notebook and export the Notebook into an HTML file.

    Submit the HTML file.

2a.  In the previous exercise, you clustered words.
     Describe how you might cluster multi-word phrases or sentences or paragraphs
     of arbitrary lengths. [2.5day]
 b.  (*Optional) Describe how you might cluster words from different languages

3.  The earliest deep-learning attention mechanism was the method proposed by
    Bahdanau in a paper on sequence to sequence models. [2day]
    Name some other variants of attention mechanisms (other than Bahdanau's method).

4.  Come up with an architecture for an ANN that would suffice to add up the digits of a 4-digit number.
    Try to find the smallest that can do the job.
    What is the minimum number of fully connected layers (separated by non-linearities)
    that an ANN must have to compute the XOR function. [2day]

5.  How can you tell if an ML model is underfitting and overfitting? [1day]
